# zwallshuffle

I decided to rewrite my app randfile in Zig. The original application being
written in Go did it's job pretty well. But, with Zig becoming popular. I
decided to learn that and rewrite a Go application.

Zig Wallpaper Shuffle (zwallshuffle) is a command line applciation that can be run
in your window manager to randomly select an image in a directory as long as
it's directed to the appropriate directory.
